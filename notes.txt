Pathway to app startup:
main.ts --> app.module.ts --> app.component.ts --> index.html --> app.component.html
**index.html is the page that is getting served up in the browser when we visit the appropriate localhost page**


Angular is a JS framework, changing the DOM (HTML) at runtime
Angular is for Single Page Applications

Angular = Components!!
======================
app component = root component
each component has its own business logic
components are reusable
each component will typically have its own folder within the project structure
component = a typescript class, instantiated by angular
components can be created "by hand", or also by using the CLI
components can be nested inside one another
a component HAS to have a template(for inline) or templateUrl(for pointing to external file)
component selector must be unique!!


Databinding
==============
communication between the typescript code(business logic) and the template(html)
4 Types:
-string interpolation {{data}}
---->whatever is put inside the double braces must ultimately resolve to a string!
---->no multi-line or block expressions
-property binding [property] = "data"
-event binding (event) = "expression"
-two-way-binding [(ngModel)] = "data"
can output data, and react to user events
