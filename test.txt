Pathway to app startup:
main.ts --> app.module.ts --> app.component.ts --> index.html --> app.component.html
**index.html is the page that is getting served up in the browser when we visit the appropriate localhost page**


Angular is a JS framework, changing the DOM (HTML) at runtime
Angular is for Single Page Applications

Angular = Components!!
======================
app component = root component
each component has its own business logic
components are reusable
each component will typically have its own folder within the project structure
component = a typescript class, instantiated by angular
components can be created "by hand", or also by using the CLI
components can be nested inside one another
